4/28/65 00:00|Newtown Square|PA|Triangle|5 minuts|cars stopped, triangular craft on ground, rose up in air,  quiet low humming sound, white light on each corner, in seconds it was gone|3/19/09|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/068/S68868.html|1|ndxe196504| cars stopped, triangular craft on ground, rose up in air,  quiet low humming sound, white light on each corner, in seconds it was gone<n> <n><n> <n><n> My mother was driving my brother and I to Lancaster, PA (I think it was a Friday) one evening, somewhere just out side of Newtown Square, PA before Goshen. It was route 3 and we were heading toward West Chester. There used to be what was called &#39;the Nikie sight.&#39; It was some sort of military installation with radars. (I wish I could remember more details about his facility and even how to spell it. (I moved out of the area in 74) Within a couple of years that facility was no longer there.) I was between 10 and 12 years old (my brother was 3 years older).<n> <n><n> <n><n> It was starting to get dark. We saw one huge triangular shape on the ground. We saw many other cars parked along the road looking at this. So we pulled over as well. People had gotten out of their cars watching in amazement. &#34;what is this thing?&#34; It was just sitting there. Within minutes of watching it it suddenly lifted straight up in the air, very low humming sound, at which point we could clearly see the triangular shape with a white light on each of the three corners. It looked like a triangular shaped donut, because as i vaguely recall we could see a triangular shape hole in the center that we could see the sky through it. I can remember the people around us saying, &#34;What is this thing?&#34; As soon as it was a couple hundred feet up in the air it took off so fast and was out of sight. We heard a sound of wind, like a wooosh and it was instantly gone out sight.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One UFO special on TV showed actual home video of a triangular shaped craft, through the trees showed a craft with 3 lights on each corner. The second I saw it, the hair on the back of my neck stood up. That was exactly what I had seen back in the mid 60&#39;s. Approximate date, hard to say I know I was between the age of 10 and 12.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I wish I had spoken out about this sooner. But i was reluctant to tell my story until i hearing more and more people testifying of the same thing.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am currently 53 years old (as of 2009). I have always wondered, if this is something of our own military, why would it not have been revealed by now. I would love to know who other than my mother and brother was parked along the road that night. Because i am sure that other information could substantiate further out eyewitness account.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

4/20/65 19:00|Orlando|FL|Disk|15 MINUTES|AS A 6TH GRADER I SAW THIS CRAFT HOVER OVER ME, AND MAKE PLANNED AND EVASIVE MANUVERS AND INCREDIBLE SPEED.|4/16/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/042/S42232.html|2|ndxe196504| AS A 6TH GRADER I SAW THIS CRAFT HOVER OVER ME, AND MAKE PLANNED AND EVASIVE MANUVERS AND INCREDIBLE SPEED.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I WAS IN 6TH GRADE THIS YEAR. I RODE MY BICYCLE TO A NEIBOURHOOD 5 AND DIME STORE. ON THE WAY TO THE  STORE I HAD SEEN SOMETHING IN THE SKY BUT DIDNT IT DIDNT REALLY CATCH MY INTEREST. ON THE WAY BACK IT WAS ABOUT DUSK. I SAW A CRAFT THAT WAS IN THE EAST. IT WAS LOW TO GROUND I&#39;D SAY 1000&#39; FEET UP OR SO. AS WHERE IT WAS AT THE TIME WAS IN THE FLIGHT PATH OF A LOCAL SMALL AIRPORT, SEVERAL TIMES AS I WATCHED IT A SMALL PLANE, PIPER CUB WOULD APPROACH AND THE CRAFT WOULD DECEND TO A ALTITUDE THAT PUT IT TOO LOW FOR ME TO SEE IT, AS IF BEHIND TREE LINES. AFTER THE PLANE PASSED IT ROSE AGAIN AND SLOWLY MADE ITS WAY TOWARDS MY DIRECTION. I WAS RIDING MY BIKE BACK FROM THE STORE DURING THIS TIME. I HAD STOPPED MY BIKE IN THE ROAD,AS IT WAS A RESIDENTIAL ROAD AND NOT BUSY. THE  CRAFT CAME TO WHERE I WAS AND HOVERED OVER ME FOR QUITE SOME TIME. AT THIS TIME IT WAS NO MORE THAN A BASEBALL FIELD IN HEIGHT ABOVE ME.AS I LOOKED AT IT, IT APPEARED TO BE METALLIC, AND HAD LIGHTS AROUND THE EDGE. I CAN NOT REMEMBER NOW IF THE LIGHTS WERE SPINNING OR NOT, BUT I DONT BELEIVE SO. WHAT STRUCK ME WAS THAT THE DOME PART OF THE CRAFT SEEMED TO HAVE SOME SORT OF WINDOW. I SAY SOME SORT, BECAUSE THEY SEEMED METALLIC BUT SOMEWHAT TRANSPARENT. I COULDN&#39;T SEE INSIDE BUT COULD SEE LIGHT AS IF A LITE INERIOR AND THE SILOUETTE OF SOME BEING. IF I WAS TO SAY WHAT IT APPEARED LIKE IN TODAYS STANDARD, I WOULD SAY ALMOST LIKE LOOKING THROUGH A WINDOW WITH METALLIC WINDOW TINT ON IT. AS I WATCHED IT I THOUGHT TO MYSELF &#34; IF ONLY LARRY, A FRIEND OF MINE WHO LIVED A BLOCK DOWN THE ROAD COULD SEE IT. I GOT ON MY BIKE AND STARTED RIDING TOWARDS HIS HOUSE. AS I APPROACHED I HEARD HIM YELLING AS HE CAME OUTSIDE TO HIS BROTHER LLOYD TO COME OUTSIDE, THAT THERE WAS A FLYING SAUCER OUTSIDE. HE TOLD ME THAT ANOTHER FRIEND WHO LIVED A COUPLE BLOCKS AWAY SAW IT WHILE CLOSING A WINDOW AND CALLED HIM TO TELL HIM ABOUT IT. ALSO SEVERAL OTHER PEOPLE AROUND LARRY&#39;S HOUSE CAME OUT ALSO. THEY HEARD THE COMMOTION AND ALSO SAID THAT THEY HAD ELECTRICAL PROBLEMS. WE WATCHED IT FOR SEVERAL MORE MINUTES AS IT MOVED FROM EAST TO WEST AND BACK AS IF SEARCHING FOR SOMETHING OR LOOKING AT SOMETHING. AT THIS POINT THE SKY WAS PRETTY DARK AND THE MOON WAS FULL IN THE LOW EASTERN SKY. THE CRAFT MADE A FAST TRACK UPWARD AND TOWARDS THE WEST, THEN MADE A INSTANT TURN EAST AND WITHIN  A SPAN OF LESS THAN A COUPLE SECONDS AT MOST IT  WAS ALL THE WAY ACROSS THE HORIZON FROM EAST TO WEST AND OUT OF SITE. I WILL  SAY THAT WHERE I LIVE AT THE TIME WAS JUST OUTSIDE OF WHAT WAS THE ORLANDO AIRFORCE BASE. WHICH LATER BECAME ORLANDO NAVAL BASE. IT COULD HAVE BEEN SOME MILITARY EXPERIMENT, BUT I HAD NEVER AND TO THIS DATE, STILL HAVE NOT SEEN ANYTHING THAT MOVED THAT FAST, TURNED ON A DIME AND DISAPPEARED SO QUICKLY. ALSO, I HAD SEEN BLIMPS IT WAS NOT ONE OF THESE. IT NEVER HAD ANY SOUND THAT IT MADE. EVEN WHEN IT LEFT SO FAST. I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT IT BROKE THE SOUND BARRIOR, BUT NO BOOM WAS HEARD OR THE SOUND OF AIR DISTURBANCE.ANOTHER THING THAT AFTER THE FACT AND AS I GOT OLDER IS THAT I NEVER FELT ANY FEAR, EVEN THOUGH I GOT THE IMPRESSION THAT IT WAS WATCHING ME AS IT HOVERED ABOVE ME. I THINK I USED THE BASEBALL FIELD AS A REFERENCE IN HEIGHT AS THAT I HAD PLAY BASEBALL AT AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL I ATTENDED AT A TIME AND THAT WAS A COMPARISON I COULD MAKE AT MY AGE.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

4/1/65 22:30|Nesquehoning|PA|Triangle|1 minute|3 lights in a triangle over Nesquehoning, PA; also reported over Shenandoah, PA - April 1, 1965|8/7/11|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/082/S82800.html|5|ndxe196504| 3 lights in a triangle over Nesquehoning, PA; also reported over Shenandoah, PA - April 1, 1965<n> <n><n> <n><n> I’m writing this on behalf of my father and only stumbled across this site after investigating the story that he relayed to me.  I surprisingly discovered that two other reports of a similar nature were posted for the same geographic region in roughly the same era.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On Thursday, April 1, 1965, my father was returning home from a Naval Reserve meeting in Hazleton, PA, on Rt. 93 in Nesquehoning, PA.  While descending the grade of the hill coming into Nesquehoning, he noticed three (3) red lights in the sky that appeared to be hovering over the town itself.  At first he thought they were the warning lights for the nearby radio station tower, but then realized that the radio tower was much farther to the southwest and probably not even visible from his location. The lights then moved northwest toward Rt. 54.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He returned home and didn’t say anything to anyone about the incident until the next morning when it was announced on the local radio station that several people in Shenandoah, PA, saw something similar.<n> <n><n> <n><n> While researching this incident I found two other reports of three lights in a triangular formation over Shenandoah in the early-1960s.  The years were approximate on the other reports but the other information was identical: the evening of April 1.  The other report states that the lights were seen over Shenandoah around 8:00 PM but the lights then headed east, which would have easily put the same lights over Nesquehoning around 10:30.  The radio station report said that others in Shenandoah saw the lights around 10:45 PM, and Shenandoah could be made in 15 minutes by air from Nesquehoning.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Are they the same but changed color? I’m not sure because I wasn’t there but I can only pass along what he has relayed to me.  He’s also a hardcore skeptic when it comes to UFOs.  As he said to me: &#34;I don’t believe in that UFO stuff, but I saw something that night and I don’t know what it was.&#34;<n> <n><n> <n><n> For me, the similarities with the location, dates, and times (8:00 to 10:30 PM) make the reports too similar to not be the same incident.<n>
4/1/65 15:30|Schertz|TX|Disk|15 secs|Flying Disk seen approx 150 ft above ground near Randolph AFB|1/28/99|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/004/S04995.html|6|ndxe196504| Flying Disk seen approx 150 ft above ground near Randolph AFB<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is a sighting I had as a child and to this day still see it in my mind like it was yesterday because it was such an overwhelming experience. it was approx 1965 before I was not quite old enough to go to school and i used to always go outside to look down the road to see my brothers and sister coming home from school. We lived in what was called Riedels trailer park in Schertz, TX, off of highway 78. My dad was stationed at Randolph AFB and it was only 1.5 miles down the road. This one afternoon I went outside to check if my siblings were coming down the road home and glanced up in the sky between the trees that were on each side of our road and approx 150 FT in the air was a whitish disk sailing through the air with no sound. It was tilted on its axis toward me like it was making a turn. I froze and followed it through the air which was about 15 secs when it became obstucted from my view by the old Starlite theater screen we lived directly behind. i have told a few people in my liftime and the best i always described it was like it was made out of concrete, the color description it looked like. It was approx i&#39;d say 50 ft in diameter and approx 8 to 10 feet thick. it was like a giant nickel but whitish color. there were not any markings on it i could see and no windows. I never heard a sound. The weather that day was clear and i was i&#39;d say approx 1/4 to 1/2 mile away from it as it seem to make an arc in flight around me. I rushed in the house and told my mom but she said i probably just saw an airplane. I was about 4 to 5 years old at the time. I would have to assume that alot of people would have seen it since it was so close to ground and good weather. I havent seen anything in the blue book files about it; you&#39;d think you would since it was right by the air force base. The object left no trail or emitted any kind of light either.<n>
4/1/65 15:00|West Germany||Disk|8 sec.|Saucer with lights, did not appear to be moving fast.|6/12/07|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/056/S56836.html|7|ndxe196504| Saucer with lights, did not appear to be moving fast.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was stationed in Meunchweiller Germany from May of 1965 until May of 1968.  At the time I was a cryptographic repairman for NATO’s Central Army Group (Centag).  This was the primary reason I did not report the sighting.  I was afraid that I would lose my clearance and not be able to work in my field.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I sighted the object when my wife and a married couple stationed in Meunchweiller were on a weekend trip to Frankfurt.  I can’t remember the exact date but it was in the early spring of 1967.  We were on the Autobahn heading north.  I was driving; my wife was in the front passenger seat turned to her left talking to the couple in the back seat.  I looked to my right through the passenger side window and caught a glimpse of an object in the sky.  The terrain on the right side of the auto was a mixture of fields and small patches of evergreen trees.  The view was broken from time to time.  At first I thought it was a plane, possibly military.  Then there was an open field with no trees that gave me about a 5 or 6 second uninterrupted view.  The object was thin and came to a point on both sides.  It was gray semi dull aluminum color.  Along the centerline were several bright spots.  They radiated an orange/green, iridescent color.  It was in a swirling fashion, the colors did not stay in the same spot within the “light”.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The other passengers were absorbed in a conversation so I tried to view the object as long as I could.  The tree line came back and obstructed my vision from time to time.  Although at times I could still see it through the trees.  Then a large forest went by and I lost sight of the object completely.  I puzzled over it in my mind while the others were conversing about other things.  I am an aircraft fan of sorts, especially WWII.  It bothered me that I could not see a vertical stabilizer or a wing root from the perspective that I viewed.  At the time I did not consider it to be a possible UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Later on I read an article about UFO’s and saw different impressions.  There was one that fit the object I saw exactly.  Only a few weeks had expired but then I realized my occupation in the Army.  I was not willing to take the chance of losing my security clearance because of the apparent mindset of such claims at the time.  Now that the equipment I maintained is totally declassified and you can see them on the internet I wanted to add maybe an insignificant sighting.  Maybe it was seen by someone else at that time and it would help in some way.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))<n>
4/1/65 05:30|Austin|TX|||austin tx 5:30 am april 1, 1965 clear circular craft hovering above courthouse.|6/12/08|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/063/S63238.html|8|ndxe196504| austin tx 5:30 am april 1, 1965 clear circular craft hovering above courthouse.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was just wondering if you or anybody knew of the sighting of the ufo on April 1st, 1965 in Austin Tx. @ 5:30 A.M.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I mean, it was in the newspaper that morning there, about a crystal clear ufo hovering above the courthouse, but when I tried to review the account later in the day, it was &#34;hush-hush&#34;, and no more newspapers could be bought and no one seems to know anything about the first morning posting, it&#39;s like a cover up or something. The paper I bought disappeared, and no record can be located in the archives, so far as I can locate.  Just very peculiar, was this a hoax for April Fools Day or what??<n>
