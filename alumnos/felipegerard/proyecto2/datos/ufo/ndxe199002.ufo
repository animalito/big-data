I watched it for about 10 minutes........I was trying rationalize that it was a balloon or something I could explain.I got into my truck,and drove down to the beach.....when I got there,it was gone.I know what I saw was a disc shaped object,and I could see it very clearly.Even though I have waited close to 18 years to report this..I KNOW WHAT I SAW!!<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

The area is farmed out but is also generally wooded near the Blanco Bend River. Between 10:00 and 10:30pm on the aforementioned date, ((name #2 deleted)) was walking home from a nearby fast food restaurant. He was aware of the time because he had just gotten a new watch recently and was looking at it frequently. It was a quiet, dark and very cool evening with clear skies and bright stars. The new moon occurred on this night so the sky was moonless.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name #2 deleted)) happened to look skyward in order to observe some of the constellations, &#34;And there it was!&#34;, he said. His first thought was, What the hell is THAT?&#34; He was not afraid, he said, but was amazed. He had considered himself to be sceptical about UFO&#39;s, so the experience was impressive and highly elating.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The object was triangular in shape, but it was as if the points of the triangle had been cut off. The cut was perpendicular to the bisection of the anglefor the leading apex, and the other two points were either cut the same as the leading apex or cut perpendicular to the trailing edge of the UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name #2 deleted)) raised his armto an angle of about 60° as an indication of the initial zenith angle relative to him. He could see only the underside surface of the object and it was glowing faintly orange over it&#39;s entirety, like very hot metal.There were no lights and no visible protuberances, but ((name #2 deleted)) did appear to notice what appeared to be geometric shapes on the surface, formed with straight lines. He believes that these were part of the objects structure, rather than decals (painted). He said that the object was &#34;remarkably similar&#34; to those depicted in the &#34;Unsolved Mysteries&#34; segment on Belgium UFO&#39;s.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((name #2)) aproximated the arms-length size of the object to be 4&#34;-4.5&#34; (or 10-12 times the size of a full moon). He guessed that the object must have been over 1000 feet away, but then indicated that he was not too good with scales or distances.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The vehicle was moving very slowly and in a straight line from south to north (from his right to his left) perpendicular to his walking direction. There was no sound of any kind from the vehicle or otherwise-including no dogs barking. (Any dogs barking would probably have been due to the presence of the object.) He was so taken by the once sighting that he never once gave thought to the possibility that other such objects may have been in the area. ((name #2)) said that he must have watched the object for ten minutes before it passed out of site behind the trees. It never changed speed, direction or altitude during that time. After the object disappeared from view, ((name #2)) continued to stand and look for several minutes, totally awestruck by the experience.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Immediately upon returning home, ((name #2)) called the Hays County Sheriff&#39;s Department and reported the sighting. The Dispatcher told him that THERE HAD BEEN OTHER CALLS REGARDING A UFO SIGHTING THAT VERY EVENING! Later, early Monday morning, ((name #2)) called a local Austin FM Radio Station and told a DJ friend of his sighting. After watching the NBC Network&#39;s UNSOLVED MYSTERIES program on the Belium UFO&#39;s during the late fall of 1991, ((name #2)) called their 800 number and reported his sighting.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In March Of 1992, ((name #2)) called an Austin ************** group who referred him to someone named ((name #3)) (doesn&#39;t remember last name). ((name #3)) pointed ((namd #2)) to some woman (name not remembered) who referred him to Austin MUFON. On March 23, 1992, ((name #2)) called Austin MUFON and told Mrs. ***** ****** of his sighting. ((name #4)) provided an outline of the sighting to me on March 28, 1992 at a regular MUFON meeting. Scott also called the Hays County Sheriff&#39;s Department to get more information on the UFO sighting. He was told that they had no record of his report or any other report of the UFO.<n> <n><n> <n><n> On May, 25, 1992 at 2:00pm CST, I met with name #2)) at his residence and received his report.<n>

As we all know the moon does not travel on a north west trajectory...  Especially over here on the north American continent.  The last time that I saw it it went over a hill and I lost sight of it..

It was either 9 individual craft,or one giant ship.Huge. It moved from the south-southwest to the north-northeast in abruptly changing increments over the Mississippi River.There was no sound. The lights were blueish-white,and did not flash. We were 20 ish at the time,having a winter 4x4 off road jaunt. The skies were perfectly clear,these were not stars.

At the time of my encounter, though, I was a columnist and editor, so I like to believe that, given my educational background and exposure to the public, I am not one prone to delusions, misinterpretations or any type of need for acclaim. It was a cold winter evening. The bus had just dropped me off near the corner of Guelph Line and Upper Middle Road. Before me lay perhaps two acres of school property that I needed to cross in order to reach home. While walking across the field, partly covered in snow, I noticed a chevron-shaped object silently hovering perhaps 500 feet overhead. Rather than immediately wondering what the object could be, I wondered how anything could hover, since the winds were quite fierce from west to east. Focusing my eyes on the object, I couldn&#39;t make out its true shape, given that the object was obscured by the thick snow clouds racing past. Yet a series of red and blue lights along its bottom ran in the shape of a chevron, so I could only assume that the craft was the same shape. I watched the object hover for perhaps a minute, and then it slowly began moving northward while retaining its altitude. I don&#39;t know why, but I began running after it, yet it slowly moved away. Pausing just south of Dundas Street and Guelph Line, the object then moved slowly westward before disappearing amid the clouds. Afterward, for all of the running that I&#39;d done in the cold, and for all of the deep gulps of air that I&#39;d taken in my exertions, I came down with a severe cold and had to spend a few days sick in bed. This is the first that I&#39;ve spoken of the incident since it happened, and I don&#39;t know why I waited so long. It&#39;s strange, but when something extraordinary is happening, one knows that it&#39;s real, but when the event has passed, it&#39;s easy to believe that the event never happened. Or perhaps I&#39;m like many in that I am often afraid of ridicule. At any rate, this is my account of something extraordinary th! at happe ned to me, and while I can do little with words to convince anyone of the authenticity of what I experienced, I can rest well in the knowledge that what I&#39;ve written is the truth, and hope that, in some small way, it will help others or shed light on similar experiences of others. Thanks.<n>

We pulled off the highway along with about 40 other vehicles and we got out to have a better look.  The craft was like any other I had ever seen and I have seen plenty. I have worked in aviation for about 15 years including a tour in the U. S. Airforce. This massive craft just stopped and hovered over us for about 6 minutes. It was black or dark grey and had very few lights but there was enough residual light from the highway streeet lights to allow us to see the size and shape of the craft and some of its massive demensions. I would have some difficulty giving an exact lateral measurement except to say that it could have easily have contained a nuclear aircraft carrier. It was nearly as tall as it was long if you were to include the vertical projections. It was hexagonal in shape and had 3 vertical projections above the upper surface ending in a t tail formation located equidistant at the 120 240 and 360 degree locations if you were to look at the craft as a disk. there was one white light in the center of the bottom surface of the craft and a red and blue light on each side of the horizontal element of the vertical projections. The craft was completely silent. After about 8 minutes the craft moved suddenly and rapidly twards the northwest in the same direction that the other 2 craft had gone and was shortly followed by 5 F-16 fighters from I believe Otis ANG Base which is in close proximity to the south west near the towns of Sandwich and Falmouth. That base is no longer active. When I arived home I was shocked to find that the television news had reported that there had been sightings reported to be UFOs all up and down the east coast from Virginia to Newfoundland in Canada.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  We observe that it would be the rare exception that the news would report UFO sightings, particularly so soon after the alleged sighting.  It usually takes days for the news media to awaken to a suspected UFO-related incident, and they usually ascribe the event to meteors, swamp gas, crash dummies, aurora displays, etc..  PD))<n>

We were climbing out of Boston through large thick clouds that had open spaces between them.  We were at about 10,000 to 15,000 feet when we flew by a gap between clouds and I saw clearly a large object that struck me at first as being the shape of a hot air balloon (with no gondola), but it appeared to be solid and the diameter of the bottom narrower part was bigger and had a kind of flange shape at the bottom.  The object was mostly light colored with regularly spaced raised geometric shapes in several bands around the object.  (Seven years later when I first saw the Gulf Breeze photos, I blurted out &#34;That&#39;s what I saw!&#34;) The gap in the clouds closed in about five seconds.  I looked up and down the interior of my plane to see if any other passengers had been looking out the window and showed signs of having seen the object, but no one appeared to have been looking.  I clearly remembered that it had been just below freezing on the ground as I entered the airport, so at 10,000 feet it would have been extremely cold.  The object appeared to be motionless, relative to the clouds, and it was BIG.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  One of two serious-minded sounding reports from same witness.

My friend, a Ph. D. audiologist, and I were driving East on I-80, between twelve to fifteen miles before our planned exit near the Mississippi River Bridge when we noticed three bright lights in a triangle shaped pattern that extended from 10 degrees above the horizon to 30 degrees above the horizon. The lights were so near, and the pattern so large that I had to lean forward to look up through the windshield glass to see all three at the same time. After watching them for a while, we saw that the stars behind the &#34;triangle&#34; disappeared as the lights moved. The three bright lights seemed very close to us, and we kept remarking at how strange they looked. They moved as a unit with each of the three lights equally distant from the other two.  At first they seemed to be moving with traffic, but after some time had gone by, they began to pull ahead of us. Gradually, they moved far enough ahead of us that the pattern was smaller than the rearview mirror, and they appeared to be at less than five degrees above the horizon. Before they (it) pulled completely away from us, I recall seeing a military jet being refueled in the sky and the lights seemed to be nearer to the ground than the two planes engaged in the refueling. We had no scale to measure it, but it seemed to be twenty times the size of the larger plane. Finally, it disappeared in the sky over the East bound highway. We had been so interested in the lights that we missed seeing the Mississippi River (and our exit to the Quad Cities) and ended up about 30 miles into Illinois. We had to find and exit and backtrack 40 miles to Rock Island. Neither of us had seen anything like this before.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Changed direction and dissapeared upwards.|8/5/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/018/S18770.html|14|ndxe199002| Very small cylinder type object viewed close up.  Changed direction and dissapeared upwards.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am a BA Honours Graduate and have always been reasonably bright at school.  I had no interest in UFO&#39;s at the time I made my sighting and was a run of the mill schoolboy living in a typical street in York. When I had this sighting I was around 11 years old.  I am not sure of the exact date but I am aware that it was sometime in the summer holidays as I was not at school and it was a bright sunny day. We lived in an estate of semi detached houses at the time.  Our garden was small and there is a small drive that seperates our house from the house to the right of us.  The house is located in the suburbs of York. The incident happened very quickly but I am clear in my mind of what I saw, how it behaved and what it looked like.  Although the incident happened a long time ago I was so taken back by what I saw that it has left a clear imprint on my memory. I was standing at my patio doors (which were closed) and looking into the garden.  My mother was hoovering the living room behind me. As I was looking into the garden 1 Object entered my vision from the right. A small cylinder shaped object floated over the fence on the right of the garden.  Its trajectory showed it had come between the houses and it was only 1 or 2 feet away from the corner of the house as it passed over the fence. The trajectory was a slow curve as it seemed to have risen up to avoid the fence and then continued downward after clearing the fence.  (the downward curve took the object from about 8 feet in the air to 6 feet and the object was travelling between 5-10mph).  As I first seen the object it was rising though, so i am sure that it had risen over the fence and dropped again into the garden. At this time it was travelling away from me but coming across my vision.  I was only around 10 feet away from the object at this time.  It then curved sharply upwards and at this point I grabbed my mother who was hoovering behind me. &#34;whats that&#34; I said and pointed.  She looked at it for a good few seconds and we both watched it dissapear out of view.  It floated almost like a balloon but rose at such a pace that it was soon out of site.  It also clearly moved in several directions before its steep climb, which shows it was not being blown by the wind. The object was of a grey black colour, of a cylinder shape and very small.  (One of my first thoughts was that it was a balloon but it was the wrong shape,too small and made at least three clear changes in direction.  The object cannot have been more than 5-10 cm from top to bottom and 2-3 cm diameter.  I could not make out any detail on the object so you could say that it was smooth. I heard no noise. Although I was a little intrigued, the fact that this was such an unremarkable and small object made me put it out of my mind.  The only thing that really intrigued me is the way that it moved.  It was totally unexplainable how an object this small could be capable of self powered flight.  One further thing to mention is that the cylinder remianed upright throughout flight and did not spin or wobble, as would be excepted from an object floating in the wind. I realise how easy it is to discredit stories like these and I admit that moments after I had seen the object I began to look for a &#39;rational&#39; explanation.  I could not think of one.  Perhaps other people have seen similar things or could shed some light on a possible rational explantion.<n>

While driving through this rural countryside, Her husband (W2), saw something unusual off to the NE.  He pointed it out to W1 and they both began to observe more closely.   Observed was a strange object floating just above the pine trees on the right side of the road, barely moving.  W1 driving, slowed down to a crawl to time the object&#39;s road crossover to be just above them.  The object then came to a complete stop and hovered.  Due to curvy road conditions and driver safety, W1 moved slightly down to a dirt road.  W1 then turned the vehicle around and proceeded back.  As they now viewed the object on the left side, it began to reverse it&#39;s course (BACK-UP), returning in the same direction as it&#39;s initial approach.  W1 got to a nearby area to pull off and they watched as it slowly flew back to the NE, without turning around as any normal craft would have done (BACKING-UP).<n> <n><n> <n><n> Witnesses watched until the object began to vanish in the distance, then took a route on some country roads where the terrain would allow an unobstructed view and make following the object easier.  The object had by this time vanished completely.  Further searching proved futile.<n> <n><n> <n><n> W1 described the object as being DISC-LIKE, but having similar profile and a large mass sort of like a military Chinook helicopter (but larger) which is what they first considered upon seeing it.  However upon close scrutiny, there were no rotors, no sound, no wings, no windscreen, no landing gear, and no markings.  The fuselage appeared like DULL or tarnished steel, with a YELLOW-GREEN tint.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Local authorities in the area have no information regarding similar events and likewise the regional airport.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This writer, and John Bodin, ASD for south Georgia, and MUFON researcher Joye Pugh, will continue probing this matter.  Currently, local information was found that an UNIDENTIFIED resident of the OCILLA Georgia area may have recently encountered a HUGE unknown object that he thought was going to land on his home.  Efforts to locate this witness are underway, but have thus far been unsuccessful.  This may be an important witness since OCILLA is only about 20 miles to the WNW of Douglas i.e. the scene of the above described event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> NOTE TO SOUTH GEORGIA RESIDENTS---If you have any information regarding the above described event, please contact Tom Sheets, MUFON&#39;s Georgia Director, at mufonofga1@yahoo.com.    Anyone having EXPERIENCED such an event first hand, please do the following; 1) File the NUFORC report form on this site; 2) Also go to www.mufon.com and file a report there; 3)  As indicated, please contact me at the above email address.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Your information is important to MUFON and to NUFORC.  All witness IDENTITIES are held STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Thanks.<n> <n><n> <n><n> SD Tom Sheets, ASD John Bodin, Dr. Joye Pugh, Douglas Case Investigators-MUFON of Georgia<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We express our sincere gratitude to Tom Sheets, Director of MUFON/Georgia, for sharing this report with our Center.

Jackson exit, I noticed a round silver object coming from the right.  Object was pretty far away and high in the sky and seemed to stop over the interstate in the center of my view.<n> <n><n> <n><n> After about a minute of hovering in place it just vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The whole way home I tried to spot some aircraft in the area or any trails but the sky was clear.<n>
2/1/90 21:00|Brigantine|NJ|Unknown|10 min|Light hovering over beach, went dim, moved and became bright again due to my approach.|5/24/05|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/043/S43845.html|19|ndxe199002| Light hovering over beach, went dim, moved and became bright again due to my approach.<n> <n><n> <n><n> It&#39;s been awhile since the encounter but here goes…<n> <n><n> <n><n> it was sometime in February I believe in 1990 when I lived in Brigantine NJ.  Brigantine is an island and at that time the north end of the island was a wildlife refuge so there is/was no homes or roads or any man made structures on the north end.   This refuge extends maybe a mile or two, it’s a very beautiful place just the dunes, beach, sky and ocean.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I was jogging around 9:00 pm when I saw a round bright light in the distance.  It was hovering over the beach right where the waves were hitting the beach.  It was about 30 to 40 feet off the ground and was maybe 30 feet in diameter. I did not see any structure, just a bright white light.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I kept jogging toward it until I was right under it at which time it went dim, that is, the intensity of the light reduced and it glided about 100 yards away in a straight line, still in line with the waves hitting the beach, stopped and became bright again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I again jogged until I was just under it.  I thought I hear a very very faint whooshing sound but I’m not sure.  There was no real noticeable sound.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For the second time the light went dim and glided away from me still in line with the beach.  It could have went out to sea but it didn’t.  It stayed right over the hard packed sand where the sea hits the beach acting as if it was trying to avoid me.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My curiosity got the better of me and I jogged up under the light for the 3rd time but this time it did not go dim.  At that time I decided to not push my luck and I turned around and started to jog away from the light.  I keep looking back and I believe I saw a second light coming around the bend where the marshes are and the two of them vanished.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I don’t recall any missing time and don’t believe I was abducted although I did have a weird experience about a year after this sighting while I was sleeping in bed but it’s probably not related.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.
