It must have been on for 10 or 15 minutes and went off and nothing was ever reported on it again.<n> <n><n> <n><n> They showed a disk shaped object hovering over the city with different colored lights and different pieces of equipment being raised and lowered from the bottom.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have never heard anything more about this.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We have invited the source of the report to attempt to find other witnesses.

There was two what appeared to us at the time, jets, and you could see the pilots in the plane under the canopy with oxygen masks on.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That was all there was to it, I know kind of boring, but I have wondered since then how it could have been possible back at that time for jets to have landed on a rough small field like that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My brother still remembers this also and it is like it happened yesterday.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

I was watching out of a window and by the time I manged to pull myself away and dash outside the craft had gone.  This event has stayed with me and been an important influence on my artwork ever since.  I was 8 years old at the time.  This is just one of many strange events that I have witnessed throughout my life.  The triangles were in triangular formation and there appeared to be some connection between them.  A curious sound accompanied the siting; very hard to describe, kind of metallic machine like noise.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

6/15/60|Trail (Canada)|BC||recurring|More on dreams in Seattle|4/1/01|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/016/S16984.html|9|ndxe196006| More on dreams in Seattle<n> <n><n> <n><n> I realize that you prefer to post verifiable events, and I won&#39;t mind a bit if you don&#39;t post this in your database. But the report of the dream from that fellow in Seattle 03/15/01 made the hair on the back of my neck stand up. When I was a child growing up in Trail, BC, I used to have the same recurring dream as that described by your Seattle correspondent. As I got older, the dream would recur less often. Oddly, I had the dream again, after an interval of many years, only a few months ago. In my dream, the early morning clear daytime sky is filled with these objects flying over at relatively low altitude, leaving trails that are not contrails, as I stand in our backyard watching (we lived at this location in Trail from the time I was about two years old, 1958, to 1964). Some of the objects are dark green, but many are shining, golden coloured. I don&#39;t recall seeing markings on the objects, however. I don&#39;t remember when these dreams started, but I do recall that at first I had them almost every night, sometimes more than once in a night (I usually woke up immediately after the dream, and the recollection of the dream is vivid in my mind for days afterward), then less frequently. By the time I started university in 1974, I was having them once or twice a month. By the 1980s, I seldom had the dream. As I got older, I attributed the dream to a child&#39;s interpretation of events related to the Cuban missile crisis, although I don&#39;t recall if they started at the time of this event or not. I never thought that anyone else would dream of exactly these same objects. I don&#39;t really expect (or want) to see this in the database, but I wonder if the person who contacted you from Seattle might want to know that others have had the same dream, from the perspective of where they were living.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

I am convinced without a shadow of doubt that I was a witness to this event.<n> <n><n> <n><n> From the latter part of June until the 24th of August, 1960, I  along with a friend , prospected for gold on the middle fork of the Feather River.  We gained access to the river through the little California mine, between Oroville and Quincy Ca.<n> <n><n> <n><n> For many years, I’ve wanted to collaborate this event of August, 1960, but have been unable to do so, until just a few days ago.  I’ll try to be brief and precise  On an evening in mid August, 1960, I awoke on an open air cot on a sandbar, and was watching the stars and SAC planes when my attention was diverted to movement down the canyon.  The river elevation was 1,700’ and the ridge elevation was 6-7000’.  A lighted object was silently descending vertically into the canyon.  It stopped and hovered.  The craft seemed to be rotating with internal rotating lights.  As I was watching, the vehicle sent very bright beams of light on the canyon walls, and down to the river.  From my vantage point, and because of the extreme terrain, I could not see the floor of the canyon or the river.  I may have been 200 - 300 yards, but it is  impossible to estimate the actual distance.  After a minute or so,  the bottom lights disappeared, the vehicle silently ascended and was gone very quickly.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I have discussed this event with  my wife and very close friends, but have never joined any groups, or sought information about what I had witnessed.  I would welcome some feed back on this if there is still anyone around.<n> <n><n> <n><n>

Husband/passenger was asleep. One vehicle behind me. No other traffic. Clear night, lots of stars. Saw a bright bluish &#34;star&#34; about 50-degree angle directly ahead in the night sky, which didn&#39;t twinkle and appeared to be getting larger. Within approx. 30 seconds, it had gotten as large as a &#34;dime&#34; and was getting larger and lower and glowing a bluish color. I couldn&#39;t figure out what it was. Within another 5 to 10 seconds it had gotten approx. the size of a dinner plate and appeared to be descending and coming straight at me even though it was still approx. 15 degrees up. I started yelling at my husband to wake up, as I was terrified. Within a couple of seconds it was directly in front of me at approx. 1000 ft. elevation and was enormous. It extended beyond both sides of the highway by at least 100 feet and completely silent. I could see it was round and flat, appeared metallic and was glowing a bright bluish color. I started screaming. It lit up the road like bluish daylight. It passed slightly to my right over a ridge of low mountains and crashed. There was a huge bluish light and the impact lifted my car off the road and over into the next lane, almost off the road. I pulled over, and the guy behind me pulled over, and we got out and tried to see if we could see anything, but all you could see was this huge bluish glow. The guy was just as shocked as I was. My husband had only seen it when it was right on top of us. We (both cars) drove into Barstow and went to the Highway Patrol and told them what we had seen. They said they hadn&#39;t heard about anything crashing, but they would look into it. My husband drove home because I was too shaky to drive. I called the CHP the next day. They said they were &#34;still checking it out.&#34; I called CalTech to see if the crash had registered anything, and they said they had nothing registering at that time, but they would look into it. I called Edwards Air Force Base, and they sai! d that a small plane had crashed into the mountains, but they had no info and said to call the FAA. I called FAA and they said they didn&#39;t know about any plane crash. There was nothing on the news. I told people about it, but nobody had heard anything. Very bizarre.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))<n>

Yesterday, 6 Dec. 01, I had a dentist appt. and I broght to his attention a  foreign object on one of the xrays.  He was curious about it and mentioned it was not part of a tip of a dental tool because it was to large for that and it appeared to be almost a perfect rectangle shape with just a slight extrusion barely visable to the eye.  I told him a dentist in Florida brought it to my attention in the early 60&#39;s and he said it was quite unusual and should not be there.  It is well above the roots and slightly below the nose,  right under it and slight to the side of it.  I remember very well one night I was out meeting a lover on the proposed causeway being dredged up and I was on my way back home (I was married at the time) and knew I had to be back shortly after midnight because I had told my husband I was out with a girlfriend.  While driving home I saw, what appeared to be a big ball of light streak through the sky and I expected to hear a huge sound but didn&#39;t.  I wondered what in the heck it was.  I lost approx. 4 - 4 1/2 hours somewhere in time because I made it home just in time to shower and get ready for work.  I was terribly confused about it but for some reason I buried the memory of it as if it had not happened.  (Looking back on this now, 40 years later) it does seem rather strange that I would just dismiss it that easily.  I&#39;ve always been a very curious person even as a child and my mom would get upset with me because I would sleep walk and sometimes end up on the front porch in the mornings.  I know I was very different from my siblings and still am for that matter, and have always and still to this day remain almost obsessed with a sense of urgency to get a message out to others about the &#39;meaning of life&#39;; however, I am cautious now and just let others come to me.   Over the years I would awaken every a.m. around 3 am to a twinkle in the sky and I felt as though someone was communicating with me.  I have seen, in the past two y! ears, 2 UFO&#39;s and they were very shiny in appearance and were stationary in the sky for 45 minutes one time.  I was out in the yard sun bathing and it was as though I was mesmerized and after 45 minutes approx. I started timing the object&#39;s appearance, it did not zoom off anywhere, it just, in the blink of an eye, seem to blink out of the sky.  I live in Lakewood, CO now and this is where I saw the two objects within the past two years.   A friend of mine saw the UFO the day I was sun bathing.   I did a series of airbrush paintings and titled them the Pleadian Series, and gave them all away but one which I still have.  I don&#39;t know if this is of any help to your web site or to others who may have thought they were &#34;seeing things&#34;  but if it helps that is good.     Thank you.

My dog went to the back of his doghouse and wouldn&#39;t come out, i felt like my body was picky, next thing i knew my mom was shaking me and telling me i was in trouble with her as she had been looking for me for an hour to come in to tske my bath.The sky was darker then and my can of worms was empty. Guess they wanted to know what i was up too. I was born in 1948. Seems like it happened just yesterday. I also had an experience where in 1975 married with 2 kids living in a trailer in the same area i saw a metellic form at the foot of my bed. Figered i was dreaming but next day a faint red glow was above the trailer roof my husband was painting an olly for the kids and when he dunked the brush in the paint can the paint seemed to jump off the brush onto the olly(bannana riding toy) and spelt the words help me.

They were in an east/west line, hovering somewhere in the vacinity of the town (we were 1 mile north of town). As best as I can remember they appeared about the size of a silver dollar at arms length. They were clearly visible--there was absolutely no mistaking what we saw. We could see white lights revolving around the lower part of the upper section of the craft (just above where the larger bottom part began). They hovered for 4 or 5 minutes, then the one on the east flew very, very fast to the south, and the other two craft got in line behind it and in just about 3 or 4 seconds they were totally gone from the horizon. My Dad never reported it because we didn&#39;t have pictures and he figured no one would believe us back then.<n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  We presume the sighting was an afternoon sighting.

I was standing at a bus stop, in the late afternoon.  I don&#39;t recall the month or date exactly, but it had to have been either 1959 0r 1960.  The incident occurred when I was standing at a bus stop. I happened to glance at the sky and was stunned to see far off in the distance, a huge saucer shaped object speeding across the sky.  I say huge, because of its size, in relationship to its distance away.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The edge of the &amp;quot;ship&amp;quot; looked silver, as if the sun was reflecting off it.  The sighting was over in seconds ( two or three seconds, at the most )  If I hadn&#39;t looked at that spot, at that exact moment in time, I would not have seen it.  I never mentioned the incident to anyone, until years later, as I thought I would be laughed at.<n> <n><n> <n><n> This is the only time I have ever seen a UFO. I am a retired RN, now 70 years old but I can still remember the event as if occurred yesterday.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I am reporting it now, as George Noorey had a guest on his show tonight, who advised anyone who had seen a UFO, to report the sighting, no matter how long ago it occurred.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

Photograph to follow.|7/11/00|http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/013/S13287.html|22|ndxe196006| Cigar shaped object dropped pieces of heated metal.  I acquired one of the pieces in 1962.  Photograph to follow.<n> <n><n> <n><n> In approximately  1960, while the writer was in Puerto Rico, his friend, ((name deleted)), of Wenonah, New Jersey, was by his account near a New Jersey dump, where he saw a cagar shaped flying saucer, hovering in the air near the ground.  A door opened in the saucer, hovering in the air near the ground.  A door opened in the saucer and Joe, a railroad stationhouse worker, heard banging from inside the saucer, like a banging on radiator pipes,  The some pieces of metal were thrown out of the saucer and landed in \ the sand.  Whe the saucer flew away, Joe found the metal pieces were still hot.  And, the piece he later gave to the writer has sand grain marks in it, and while the outside is generally smooth, the inside is crystalline, as if the outside had started to melt. Until the writer wrote this, eh did not realize the discreepancy between the outsdie and the inside appearance of the metal. The piece has a smoothly curved, machined or molded surface on one side.  The piece which the writer has is now in safekeeping has a smooth, curved portion.  It weighs about  2.75 ounces and had broken down three small pieces from it, as follows: 1.  Dissolved in concentrated nitric acid.  It did not dissolve, but turned, over a week, into a white powder. 2.  Gave to Prof. ((deleted))  University. Dr.((deleted)) had a student analyze it, and it was found to be indium antimonide. (this was in 1970).  They said it is spectroscopically pure antimony.<n>

I remember my mom asking me about my twin brother and if I had seen him and I told her no.  It was the beginning of the summer vacation in June, the weather was warm and there wasn&#39;t a cloud in the sky.  All of a sudden my twin comes busting through the door with a look of terror on his face and screaming so loud and incoherently that we couldn&#39;t understand anything he was saying.  My mom grabbed ahold of him and held him close to try to calm him down and when he did he told her something that to this day, I will never forget.<n> <n><n> <n><n> He told her that he was playing at the school.  Winterstein school in Sacramento, California. He said he was playing in the playground and had looked up to the sky because it got &#34;cloudy&#34; all of a sudden.  When he looked up he saw a large silver object that looked like a &#34;school bus&#34; with lights all around the middle part and could see &#34;people&#34; looking out the &#34;windows&#34; at him.  But when he looked closer at them, he said they weren&#39;t like any &#34;people&#34; but had very large black eyes and were all silver.  My mom got him calmed down and he went into his bedroom and slept for the rest of that day into the next day.<n> <n><n> <n><n> My brother finished high school and went into the Air Force as a Radar spec./technician.  He served his tour of duty and I hadn&#39;t heard from him for nearly the whole 6 years he had served.  When he got out, he came home and got in contact with the family and I invited him over.  I had a chandelier that needed some work and asked if he would look at it for me.  He was happy to do it.  He got on the ladder and I started to ask him questions about when we were in kindergarten and when he saw the &#34;school bus&#34; in the sky.  He affirmed everything that he had told us at the time and said he didn&#39;t know what it was and that he had in fact seen the same exact thing four times.  Once again right after he had joined the Air Force while on a training ship, and another time while he was out at sea on his ship coming home from Okinawa and another time after he had bought some property in Bodega Bay, California.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I had, at the time, been reading one of Bud Hopkins books that had drawings and depictions of the &#34;greys&#34;.  I was being very careful about what I was saying as he was looking and sounding a little nervous about talking about it and I didn&#39;t want to make him too uncomfortable, yet my curiosity got the best of me and I picked up my book and showed him one of the drawings in the book of an alien with large black eyes and &#34;dressed&#34; in &#34;silver&#34;.  When I showed this to him, he climbed down off the ladder and bluntly told me that he didn&#39;t want to talk about it anymore and he would never talk to me about it again.  He was very angry with me for bringing it up and to this day I regret showing it to him at that time.  We have had very little contact since then and I don&#39;t know how I can repair the rift that has come between us.<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

It descended a hook and lift a very big snake up. While snake was being lifted, a colored light surrounded it. In Mardin most of the people sleep in open air areas in the hot summer days. Since she frightened, she covers herself and tried to sleep. When my mother told me this event she commented that she had never seen such a big snake in her life.<n>

We watched it,along with two or three other cars, for about 15 minutes.  It was about 50 feet above the 50 foot trees along the river.  Made of pure ultra blue light, it went out like a light switch had been used.  It sat on the ground and there was no noise or movement.  The area along the river is still there with nothing there, although a lot of the trees are gone now.<n> <n><n> <n><n> We were learning to play a card game and was on our way home from Parker Heights (outside of Yakima) and came around the bend in the road and I said to my then husband, what to he-- is that?  I don&#39;t remember seeing anything there.  It was very tall-I always thought about 100 feet.  It was made of pure light and was a color of ultra blue that I still have not seen since.  There was two, mabey three cars stopped with us, looking at it.  We goet out of the car and stood by the guard rail and just watched it.  We were parked on the oposite side of the road and the light emmitting from it lite up the night.  I havn&#39;t talked to my ex husban for over 30 years and have never talked to him about this since.  I got busy raising my two children, basicly alone, and kind of put it in the back of my mind.  I am now 58 years old and have thought about it very often for a long time.  I know there are others out there who saw it too.  I would very much like to contact them.  The first question below asks about lights &#39;on&#39; the object--this was made of pure light.<n>

We would stomp the wheat down to make square rooms, round and rectangular shaped rooms and we would connect the room together with hall ways.<n> <n><n> <n><n> One night I looked out of the kitchen window and saw a White cube that glowed like a light bulb.  It had a red light glowing on the inside of it.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The area was north of Great Bend, Kansas. There are or were quite a few radio towers there and one huge TV 2 tower.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The cube shaped thing flew around that radio tower like a moth flies around a light bulb of all things, only slower than a moth and it never hit the tower.<n> <n><n> <n><n> I ran to the bath room to get my dad but he said don&#39;t brother him.  So I ran back to the kitchen yelling for my two brothers to come here.<n> <n><n> <n><n> When I got back to the window it was still flying around the tower.  Just before my brothers got to the window it came across the field towards me in a blink of an eye it was hovering around 75 feet above the ground.<n> <n><n> <n><n> That is when my two brothers made it to the window and started saying what is that, what is that.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The thing hovered there but very slowly turned for 20 sec. or so.  Than it spun so fast that it turned into a ball and was gone in a streak almost straight up but a little angle towards the n.w.<n> <n><n> <n><n> True true true story.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Also, I might add that the red light was fading on an off like the tower light was.  I believe it was trying to communicate with it and that it was surprised when it finally noticed me or us. I also think that it was some type of probe or something.<n> <n><n> <n><n> The work you are all doing is good work.  We saw what we saw so because of that I know we are not alone.  Sure makes you wonder why that thing was flying around that radio tower?  I don&#39;t think that making those forts in the wheat had or has anything to do with it but then again you never know like anything there are more questions than answers.  This was a real deal and I know with all the liars and hoaxes you have to be careful. But this one is true and! I hope it will or it may not help you.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Sincerely; WM<n> <n><n> <n><n> PS It was the size of a small box truck.<n> <n><n> <n><n> Report taken by the Missouri Investigators Group - B.Becker  ufomig@yahoo.com http://ufomig.bravehost.com<n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> <n><n> ((NUFORC Note:  Date of the event is approximate.
